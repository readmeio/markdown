## Edge Cases

### Heading Styles

####Compact Notation

Headers are denoted using a space-separated `#` prefix. While the space is technically required in most standard Markdown implementations, some processors allow for a compact notation as well. ReadMe supports this style, so writing this
    
    ###A Valid Heading
    
    Lorem ipsum dolor etc.

> ðŸ›‘ 
> Compact headings must be followed by two line breaks before the following block.

#### ATX-Style Notation ####

If you prefer, you can "wrap" headers with hashes rather than simply prefixing them:

    ## ATX Headings are Valid ##

#### Underline Notation

For top-level headings, the underline notation is valid:

    Heading One
    ===========
    
    Heading Two

### Incremented Anchors

Occasionally, a single doc might contain multiple headings with the same text, which can cause the generated anchor links to conflict. ReadMe's new markdown processor normalizes heading anchors by auto-incrementing similar heading's IDs. Try it out by clicking on this section header _or_ the following sub-section title:
