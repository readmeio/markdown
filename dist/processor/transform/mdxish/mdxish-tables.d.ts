/**
 * Converts JSX Table elements to markdown table nodes and re-parses markdown in cells.
 *
 * The jsxTable micromark tokenizer captures `<Table>...</Table>` as a single html node,
 * preventing CommonMark HTML block type 6 from fragmenting it at blank lines. This
 * transformer then re-parses the html node with remarkMdx to produce proper JSX AST nodes
 * and converts them to MDAST table/tableRow/tableCell nodes.
 *
 * When cell content contains block-level nodes (callouts, code blocks, etc.), the table
 * is kept as a JSX <Table> element so that remarkRehype can properly handle the flow content.
