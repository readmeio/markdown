By and large, the new markdown processor outputs standard HTML. This means most basic CSS element selectors will continue to work seamlessly. Depending on how complex your Markdown and custom CSS are, you should only have to update a few styles here and there!

## Scoping Your Styles

When writing custom styles for the new processor, you should explicitly target content generated by the new Markdown engine using the **`.markdown-body`** class prefix. You can also style Markdown for a specific template by adding additional prefixes.

```scss Markdown Selector Scope
/* Guides Pages */
#content-body .markdown-body {}

/* Reference Pages */
#api-explorer .markdown-body {}
#api-explorer .markdown-body > .pin {} /* target pinned sidebar content */
```

> **Note**: The `.markdown-body` prefix is unique to the new engine, which is useful when refactoring custom styles. In the run up to the production release, this can be a useful “hook” for progressively enhancing your custom CSS. Just prefix your selectors with the `.markdown-body` class and appending the new ruleset to your custom CSS

## CSS Variables Theming

The new Markdown engine uses CSS variables to enable simple theming for all modern browsers (i.e. IE11+.) Certain custom components offer their own theme variables. The markdown engine also offers some high-level theming variables:

```css
.markdown-body {
  --markdown-radius: 3px;
  --markdown-font: Papyrus, serif;
  --markdown-text: #333;
  --markdown-title: hotpink;
  --markdown-lineHeight: 2;
}
```

## Styling Components

### Callouts

Our callouts have been refactored to be based on the default block quote element and styling. It comes with various themes, which can be customized using the following selectors. [**More**](doc:callouts)...

### Tables

Tables have been simplified to mirror a more standard implementation, which should make them easier to style. [**More**](doc:tables)...
[block:html]
{
  "html": "<style>\n.callout.callout_default[theme=🐷] {\n  --background: #fdf2fa;\n  --title: #ed32ba;\n  --border: var(--title);\n}\n</style>"
}
